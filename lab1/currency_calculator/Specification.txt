Title: Currency Calculator


Abstract: 		 The following program allows the user to enter the rate of change 
				 of currency as compared with the U.S dollar. It then asks the user
				 how much the user wanted to convert to either to dollars or 
				 from dollar to which ever country's currency the user entered 

Introduction: 	 Ever wonder how much an item from the United States costs in
				 another country? Or how about wanting to know how much an item
				 from another country costs in the United States? The currency
				 calculator can help you deduce these costs. The only thing
				 you need to know is the exchange rate and follow the instructions
				 the calculator gives you.
   
Inputs: (double) exchange rate - There are no limits set to this input, but the
				 user should be aware that negative or zero conversion rates do
				 not exist; This the exchange rate used between countries.
				
        (double) currency amount - There are no limits set to this input, but the
				 user should be aware that negative dollars do not exist. Also,
				 if a non-integer is inputed, then the program does not compute
				 anything and asks the user if they would like to calculate
				 another value; This is the money amount the user wants converted.
				  
Outputs:(double) total amount - There are no limits set to the size of the conversion
				 rate or the currency amount, but the output will be rounded to 2 decimal
				 places (in other words, the nearest cent);
                  
Major Functions: The only major function used was the 'main' function where most of the 
				 above mentioned uses of the program were implemented.
