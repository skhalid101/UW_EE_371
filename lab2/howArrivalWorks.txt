So i just have the arrival working properly
- when you first map in on to the Board press and hold key 0 for reset of the system . 
- LEDR 7 to 4 will show you which state you are in
- Then to start arrival procedure turn on SW0 
- A timer will start and countdown from 5 to 0 
- then Hex display will ask you to pressurize 
- press and hold key 1 to pressurize 
- it will count down from 7 to 0 to show that it has pressurized 
- then it will turn on led 2 indicating that it is okay to open outer gate 
- User should turn on SW2 which is the outer gate opener switch 
- at this point i wanted hex 5 and hex 4 to display in but doesnt seem to be working 
- then you have to turn off sw2 to make sure the outer door closes 
- then Hex 0 and 1 will ask you to depressurize 
- press and hold key 2 to depressurize (evacuate chamber) 
- then led 3 will light up indicating its safe to open inner door 
- open inner door by turning in sw3 
- after turning on sw 3 i wanted again hex 5 and 4 to display 'in' oh and at this point you should probably 
  turn off sw 0 other wise if you dont u'll see what happpens LOL (stil have to fix that it just restarts 
  after to you the inner door and arrival signal is still on) 
 - then yeah you just turn off sw 3 for inner door and led 7 to 4 will show you that it goes to its initial state.
